Noted for this commit and during the tutorial:
- msg is a Solidity's global variable.
- Create an event and emit the event at the end of the function to notify if the work has done.
- Method "require(true)" to make sure all variables are filled in before execute the rest of the function.
- mapping is like define interface of an object in typescript.
- Ending function with ";" is IMPORTANT in Solidity.
